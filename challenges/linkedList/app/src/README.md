# Singly Linked List

The linked List class is a linear data structure. Also it can contain many objects of the same type and we can add items, change items and remove items.

## Challenge

This challenge about how to using a linked list to store nodes in it and also how to apply methods on it like add method to add new node in the linkecd list or view method to display the nods in the list.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Verify Big O(1) of written code.

* Verify code matches algorithm.


## API

###  Methods in LinkedList Class

* `insert(Node newNode)`: This method accepts a `Node` parameter and its purpose to add a new *Node* in the LinkedList.


* `isInclude(Node head, int item)`: This method accepts a `Node` parameter and `int` parameter and its purpose to test our Nodes' values if they are found so the test gives us true or return false.

* `stringPath()`: This method to show us the path for the nodes as a text.
