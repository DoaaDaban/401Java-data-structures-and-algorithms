# Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

1. add vertex

2. add edge

3. get vertices

4. get neighbors

5. size

## Approach and Efficiency

1. add vertex

    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(1)

2. add edge

    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(1)

3. get Vertices

    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(n) ---> n: is the number of Vertices

4. get neighbors

    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(n) ---> n: is the number of neighbor Vertices

5. size

    * Time: O(n) n: is the number of neighbor Vertices
    * Space: O(1)

## API

1. `addVertex(String data)`: This method adds a vertex to the graph and it accepts `String` parameter for the value of the vertex.

2. `addEdge(String data1, String data2)`: This method adds a new edge between two Vertices in the graph and it accepts two `String` parameters, The parameters are vertices that will add the edge between each other.

3. `getVertices()`: This method returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection.

4. `getNeighbors(String data)`: This method returns all the connections of the required vertex as a list.

5. `size()`: This method to get the number of all vertices in the graph.


# Graph Breadth First

Create a static method which returns a Set of the Graph vertices in their breadth from a specified root.

## Challenge

Create a method that take a vertex as a parameter as a start point and return a collection of vertices in the order they were visited.
